# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis
Using statistics and R to analyze automotive data in a manufacturing environment. 

Please review the RScript Challenge Code ![here.](https://github.com/JonathanBrown003/MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis/blob/f77d8ef4614efbd80107cfd92ea22c6424474cae/MechaCarChallenge.R)

## Project Summary
The goal of this project is to analyze production data for a new automotive prototype in the works. Performance is analyzed over a number of statistical tests to provide insight to the manufacturing team. Variables such as miles per gallon, vehicle length, weight, ground clearance, and all-wheel-drive capability were some of the variables analyzed.
