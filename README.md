# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis
Using statistics and R to analyze automotive data in a manufacturing environment. 

Please review the RScript Challenge Code ![here.](https://github.com/JonathanBrown003/MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis/blob/f77d8ef4614efbd80107cfd92ea22c6424474cae/MechaCarChallenge.R)

## Project Summary
The goal of this project is to analyze production data for a new automotive prototype in the works. Performance is analyzed over a number of statistical tests to provide insight to the manufacturing team. Variables such as miles per gallon, vehicle length, weight, ground clearance, and all-wheel-drive capability were some of the variables analyzed. 

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
Please see below for a summary of the data as returned in R:

1) Variance of a non-random variable is generally 0. Taking this into consideration, the intercept, vehicle_length, and ground_clearance variables can be said to provide a non-random amount of variance to the miles per gallon values in this dataset.
